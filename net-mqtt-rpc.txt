-- | Send a message to a topic on an MQTT broker with a random subscription
--   and correlation such that an agent may receive this message and
--   respond over the ephemeral channel. The response will be returned.
--   
--   Note that this client provides no timeouts or retries. MQTT will
--   guarantee the request message is delivered to the broker, but if
--   there's nothing to pick it up, there may never be a response.
